Javascript object and its representation

 “A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.

For example: student, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.

Take the case of student

All name have the same properties, but the property values differ from student to student. All students have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

1)Objects:

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

Syntax:

var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};

So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The following code assigns many values to a variable named student:

var student = {Name: “Karthish”, Age:6, gender:"Male")

2)Object propertries:


The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.

Here Name, age and gender are key, Karthish,6, male are its values respectively.

The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.

Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.


3)Object Methods

	An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

i.e.,

	Let’s assume to start the student there will be a marking functionality.

		function mark(m1,m2,m3)
		{
		}
