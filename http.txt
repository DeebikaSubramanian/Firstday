Difference between http and https

NO:1
	http stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
	https stands for hypertext transfer protocol secure

NO 2:

	http sends a plaintext request and response across the internet
	https sends a encrypted request and response

No 3:

	In http, plaintext can be read by anyone monitoring these plaintext
	In https,as it is encrypted an attacker can read see a series of random characters

so https is more secure than http
